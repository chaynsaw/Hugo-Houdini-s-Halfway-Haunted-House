October 31, 1998, Spookstown, Ohio.

Spookstown’s local tourist attraction is back up and running. Hugo Houdini’s Haunted House, named after the less notable
brother of the famous magician, is drawing in the crowds with its cheesy scares and frights. Screams of joyous terror
can be heard by those waiting in line to enter.

You are a teenager next in line, unaware you are about to enter into the adventure of a life, or perhaps your AFTERLIFE.

AFTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY INFORM MYSELF ABOUT THE EVENT, I KNOWINGLY AND FREELY ASSUME AND ACCEPT ALL RISKS, BOTH
KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, and assume full responsibility for my participation at Hugo Houdini’s Haunted House. Risks include,
but are not limited to: sprains, strains, fractures, animal bites and stings, contact with poisonous plants; and
accidents involving, but not limited to, running, falling, jumping, falling branches, lightning, contact with scenery,
DEATH, contact with actors and GHOSTS.

ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK...
