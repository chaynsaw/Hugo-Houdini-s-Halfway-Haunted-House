        <desc>The entry hall to the haunted house is dimly lit, bowls of candy sit in the corner. You are able to
make out the features of two doors and a staircase. To the EAST, chairs are lined UP around a dining room
table, to the WEST something metallic enclosed in a glass cabinet catches the candle light. The stairs lead
UP into the darkness.

        <desc>Thick glass cabinets line the perimeter of this room, displaying all sorts of oddities: old playing cards,
"magic" wands, antique pistols. Mounted animal heads adorn the high walls, grotesque sneers left on their
faces by a taxidermist with an odd sense of taste. A large grisly bear looms over the room from the far corner.

        <desc>A long table occupies the middle of the room, fully set for a dinner of eight.  Dust covers the fine
dinnerware and glasses.  A single glass at the head of the table, next to a lit candle, stands out with red
lipstick on the rim. When you move it, another identical glass materializes in its place. To the NORTH, the sounds of a
busy kitchen come from a dark room, and to the SOUTH a door opens to the outside.</desc>

the room, casting erie shadows into the corners. Out of the corner of your eye you swear something moved, but
but nothing else living appears to be with you.  The entry hall opens to the NORTH, and to the WEST a room lined
with bookshelves opens, lit by sconces along the walls.</desc>
